# 🐍 Python Basics – Practice Repository

Welcome to my Python practice repository!  
Here, I'm documenting my learning journey from the **Apna College Python Course**, organized lecture-wise and project-wise.  
I'm learning consistently — coding on mobile using **Pydroid3** with full dedication. 💪📱
